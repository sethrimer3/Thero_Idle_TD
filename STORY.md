-----PROLOGUE-----

**Journal - Page 592**

We finished the last entanglement requirements for the **℘** gate. The _WEIERSTRASS FRACTAL_ was the final key, resonating perfectly with the frequency of consciousness. It feels odd. We've been working on this project for so long. I feel nostalgic thinking about our younger selves beginning to stay late nights, starting to fill the fridge with caffeine, and all the unspoken agreements. I thought it would feel different, like reaching some grand destination that would satisfy me for the rest of my existence. Instead, it's an odd feeling of loss. I think those were _the days_. The stress of scrambling for any presentable results to prove the funding wasn't a waste seemed like hell in the moment, but it unexpectedly bonded us and turned lab C137 into a sort of holy ground.

I don't know why I'm talking like it's all over, we still have weeks of stress testing, then the live test, and we'll have more projects. Matt will be teaching in the physics department for at least another decade, that's not too far away. Perhaps I'm worred it's too easy to get distracted and move on.
