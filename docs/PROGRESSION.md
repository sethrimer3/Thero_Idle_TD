# Glyph Defense Idle – Progression Notes

## Level Structure
- The game now features **30 total levels** grouped into six five-level sets.
- Sets unlock in reverse proof order: Conjecture (1–5), Corollary (6–10), Lemma (11–15), Proposition (16–20), Theorem (21–25), and Axiom (26–30).
- Each level is built around an "immortal defense" style lane defined by a math-graph expression (figure-eights, logarithmic spirals, cardioids, etc.).
- When a level is entered **for the first time** the screen fades to black and displays a hallmark statement for that set (e.g., Goldbach's Conjecture). Subsequent visits skip the fade.
- Entered levels continue running when the player navigates to other tabs; use "Leave Current Level" on the Stage tab to reset wave flow.

### Conjecture Set (Levels 1–5)
1. **Conjecture – 1 · Lemniscate Hypothesis** – Figure-eight path generated from `r² = cos(2θ)`; introduces divisor scouts.
2. **Conjecture – 2 · Collatz Cascade** – Tiered descent inspired by the `3n + 1` map with teleport risers and hit-count enemies.
3. **Conjecture – 3 · Riemann Helix** – Logarithmic spiral tuned to ζ zero estimates; favors splash slows.
4. **Conjecture – 4 · Twin Prime Fork** – Dual rails connected by prime gaps; rewards rapid chaining damage.
5. **Conjecture – 5 · Birch Flow** – Cardioid river influenced by elliptic curve ranks; showcases enemy reversal mechanics.

Future sets escalate enemy modifiers and map complexity but follow the same five-level cadence with new example statements.

## Tower Evolution
- **α → β → γ → δ → Ω** is the primary merge ladder. α towers provide single-target bursts; two α towers merge into a β beam tower.
- β towers merge into **γ conductors** (`γ = α^½ · β`) that blend α burst spikes into β beam tempo and apply homing bolts.
- γ towers merge into **δ commanders** (`δ = γ · ln(β + 1)`) that summon glyph soldiers, slow enemies, and grant aura buffs.
- High-tier merges culminate in the **Ω keystone** (`Ω = β^(α/10) + δ · β`) which draws stats from every β tower on the field, pushes enemies backward, and adds splash damage.
- Support variants now include aura boosters, splash glyphs, homing missiles, slow fields, and enemy reversal chants.

## Enemy Archetypes
- **E-Type Glyphs** – Base enemies labeled by trailing zeros (E1 = 1 HP, E3 = 100 HP, etc.) with logarithmic health scaling.
- **Divisors** – Take damage equal to `1 / DPS`; encourage precision debuffs and tempo play.
- **Prime Counters** – Require a fixed number of hits regardless of damage; ideal for soldier swarms and rapid-fire towers.
- **Reversal Sentinels** – Upon defeat they run backward along the path; captured units fight for the player with inverted health totals.

## Achievements & Powderfall
- Each achievement seal grants **+1 grain of powder per minute**.
- Offline/idle time multiplies by the number of unlocked achievements. All stored grains are deposited immediately on return.
- Powder height etches mystic symbols along the wall. The highest reached symbol acts as an upgrade currency for tower research.
