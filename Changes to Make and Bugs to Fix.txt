Changes to make and bugs to fix:
Guideline: As you complete tasks, immediately update their checkbox from [ ] to [x] so teammates can see the latest status.
—
[] = Not done
[x] = Done
—
[x] - Put the "Tower tree map" and "Equipment" buttons below the Variables and Upgrade Matrix buttons (so they are on a separate line, currently on mobile they are "squished" and don't have enough space horizontally). Put the Tsadi, shin, and Kuf glyph counts on the line below the Aleph, Bet, and Lamed glyph counts on desktop at the top of the towers tab.
[x] - Level previews are no longer showing and the tower loadout bar at the bottom of the playing field shows the tower card again when it should just show the tower icone, Anchor, and upgrade amounts.
    - Restored the overlay preview by keeping developer mode off by default and limited tower card enhancements to the card grid so the loadout stays compact.
[x] - Lamed through Kuf spires are accessible, they should be locked and their buttons not visible before they are unlocked. Bet spire is locked but its button not show up when locked. Let's change the unlock requirement to obtaining 10 glyphs in the previous spire (so obtaining 10 Aleph glyphs unlocks the Bet spire, and so on).
[x] - The menu that appears in the top right of each spire tab that shows all the spire symbols and bank counts, let's make it so that menu on mobile is off the screen to the right and is brought in by clicking a small square button that is floating in the top right of the screen (regardless of whether the player scrolls up or down in a player tab). Put a small button at the bottom of the vertical menu that is an "X" which makes the menu hide off the screen to the right.
[x] - In the Shin spire, clicking on fractals should add one Iteron to the fractal. Make sure this is the case for every one of the fractals.
[x] - When leaving and coming back to the Tsadi spire, all the particles appear in the top right corner on top of each other, causing them to merge and also shoot out at high speed. When coming back to the Tsadi spire, the particles should appear randomly around the render and not on top of each other.
[x] - In the Tsadi spire, make sure that the repelling force and attracting force affects particles which are within 3 times the radius, so if a particle's radius is "1," particles will be affected if they are within "3." This should make it so that larger particles have a larger repelling radius. 
[x] - In the lamed spire, make the center celestial body glow from the start, but have its glow increase from 100% (what it starts out as) to 200% (simply put, twice as big) as it gets closer to the next milestone.
[x] - The Lamed spire does not have an upgrade to increase the mass of the orbiting stars the player places using sparks. There should be an upgrade that costs 5 sparks then gets twice as expensive each time, and with each tier it increases the mass of sparks placed by 1. There should be no randomness in the size of placed stars. Also with the decorative particles, on high graphics there should be about 20 times more particles that appear, on low graphics the current amount of particles should be randomly appearing. The particles should have the gradient of the currently selected color pallet going radially outward from the celestial body. Add shooting stars that randomly spawn every 10-60 seconds right outside the simulation, are affected by the gravity of the sun and will merge with the sun or the stars if it crashes into them, adding 1 to mass.
[x] - In the Shin spire, the player should be able to pan around each fractal by clicking and dragging and zoom in as well as zoom out. Currently this doesn't work on fractals beyond the Tree fractal and Koch snowflake fractal.
    - Brownian Forest and Flame fractals now tone-map onto offscreen canvases so their glow layers follow pan and zoom transforms.
[x] - Let's make it so the Voronoi glass fractal layers all slowly spin at different rates. Let's have the first layer spin very slow (one revolution per minute) and each layer after than spin 1.1x faster additively.
[x] - In the Shin spire, make it so the points in the Brownian forest fractal have glowing lines connecting them so it looks like crystal plants growing outward.
[x] - In the Shin spire, the flame spiral doesn't really look like anything and isn't interesting as Iterons are added to it. See if you can make it more interesting.
